# FED3ArduinoCode
A collection of various Arduino sketches related to the Burgess Lab FED3 setup. Currently including 

[Perseverative Learning Paradigm](https://github.com/katiefurms/FED3ArduinoCode/blob/main/persLearningKLF)
 - Allows the two FED ports to be programmed with different probabilities of releasing a pellet, with a CS+ (blue LED colorwipe) paired with food release, and a CS- (tone) paired with food not being released. These probabilities can also be programmed to flip after N n umber of pokes, allowing for observation of perseverative errors after learning.
